Rosetta version 3.9 was used throughout.  

## Loop Modeling

Loops not resolved in the crystal structure [PDB 6O6E](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6O6E) were modeled with rosetta. 
The file 606E-2fad.pdb contains the PltF-AcpP input structure aligned in PyMOL as described in the manuscript.

The remodel file was generated by running:

    /PATH_TO_ROSETTA/rosetta/3.9/tools/remodel/getBluePrintFromCoords.pl -pdbfile ./606E-2fad.pdb -chain A > ./606E-2fad.remodel

The resulting 606E.remodel file was modified as follows:

    ...
    11 V .
    12 K L PIKAA K
    0 x L PIKAA K
    0 x L PIKAA P
    0 x L PIKAA G
    13 S L PIKAA S
    14 S .
    ...
    
Loop remodeling was run:

    /PATH_TO_ROSETTA/rosetta/3.9/main/source/bin/remodel.static.linuxgccrelease -database /PATH_TO_ROSETTA/rosetta/3.9/main/database/ -s ./606E-2fad.pdb -run:chain A -remodel:use_blueprint_sequence -remodel:blueprint ./606E-2fad.remodel -ex1 -ex2 -use_input_sc -overwrite
    
## Structure Relaxation 

    /PATH_TO_ROSETTA/rosetta/3.9/main/source/bin/relax.static.linuxgccrelease -database /PATH_TO_ROSETTA/rosetta/3.9/main/database/ -relax:fast -s ./606E-2fad_loop_modeled.pdb -ex1 -ex2 -use_input_sc
    
 ## Interface Design
 
 The interface_design.xml file was modified from this [Rosetta Demo](https://new.rosettacommons.org/demos/latest/public/design_raf_rac_interface/README).
 
    /PATH_TO_ROSETTA/rosetta/3.9/main/source/bin/rosetta_scripts.static.linuxgccrelease -s ./606E-2fad_loop_modeled_relaxed.pdb -database /PATH_TO_ROSETTA/rosetta/3.9/main/database/ -parser:protocol ./interface_design.xml -ex1 -ex2 -nstruct 1000 -overwrite
 
 For modifying the score function, the following commandline flag was added to the above:
 
    -score:set_weights fa_elec 1.5
    
 Terms and weights for the REF2015 score function can be found [here](https://new.rosettacommons.org/demos/latest/tutorials/scoring/scoring).
 
 ## Analysis
 
 To generate input list of structures for analysis:
 
    ls 606E-2fad_loop_modeled_relaxed_* > list.txt
    
 The python script SequenceProfile.py was used to analyze the sequence profile:
 
    python2.7 SequenceProfile.py -l list.txt -t 606E-2fad_loop_modeled_relaxed.pdb
 
 To generate point mutant pdb structures, the mutate.xml file was used by running:

    /PATH_TO_ROSETTA/rosetta/3.9/main/source/bin/rosetta_scripts.static.linuxgccrelease -s ./606E-2fad_loop_modeled_relaxed.pdb -database /PATH_TO_ROSETTA/rosetta/3.9/main/database/ -parser:protocol ./mutate.xml -ex1 -ex2 -nstruct 1
